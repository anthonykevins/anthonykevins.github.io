      <description>My research investigates the interplay between public opinion and policy, with a special focus on marginalised groups and the welfare state. Some of the questions I&amp;rsquo;ve explored include: What factors shape the relationship between societal insiders and outsiders? How can we best understand social policy preferences? And what drives welfare state reform?
My studies have been published in journals such as Socio-Economic Review, the European Sociological Review, and Political Studies. You can also find discussions of my research in The Globe and Mail, Maclean&amp;rsquo;s, and Le Monde.</description>
